**This Library is still pre-0.1.0 the API is therefore in heavy flux, and everything should be considered alpha!**

A small library for conveniently working with immutables bytes from different sources, providing zero-copy slicing and cloning.

Access itself is extremely cheap via no-op conversion to a `&[u8]`.
 
The storage mechanism backing the bytes can be extended
and is implemented for a variety of sources already,
including other byte handling crates `Bytes`, mmap-ed files,
`String`s and `Zerocopy` types.

[^1]: Recently added a new "Owned Bytes" variant, which still has all the downsides of a V-Table.
