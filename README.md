**This Library is still pre-0.1.0 the API is therefore in heavy flux, and everything should be considered alpha!**

A small library for conveniently working with immutables bytes from different sources, providing zero-copy slicing and cloning.

Access itself is extremely cheap via no-op conversion to a `&[u8]`.
 
The storage mechanism backing the bytes can be extended
and is implemented for a variety of sources already,
including other byte handling crates `Bytes`, mmap-ed files,
`String`s and `Zerocopy` types.

## Overview

`Bytes` decouples data access from lifetime management through two traits:
[`ByteSource`](src/bytes.rs) and [`ByteOwner`](src/bytes.rs).  A `ByteSource`
can yield a slice of its bytes and then convert itself into a `ByteOwner` that
keeps the underlying storage alive.  This separation lets callers obtain a
borrow of the bytes, drop any locks or external guards, and still retain the
data by storing the owner behind an `Arc`.  No runtime indirection is required
when constructing a `Bytes`, and custom storage types integrate by
implementing `ByteSource`.

## Quick Start

```rust
use anybytes::Bytes;

fn main() {
    // create `Bytes` from a vector
    let bytes = Bytes::from(vec![1u8, 2, 3, 4]);

    // take a zero-copy slice
    let slice = bytes.slice(1..3);

    // convert it to a typed View
    let view = slice.view::<[u8]>().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(&*view, &[2, 3]);
}
```

The full example is available in [`examples/quick_start.rs`](examples/quick_start.rs).

## Advanced Usage

`Bytes` can directly wrap memory-mapped files or other large buffers.  Combined
with the [`view`](src/view.rs) module this enables simple parsing of structured
data without copying:

```rust
use anybytes::Bytes;
use zerocopy::{FromBytes, Immutable, KnownLayout};

#[derive(FromBytes, Immutable, KnownLayout)]
#[repr(C)]
struct Header { magic: u32, count: u32 }

fn read_header(map: memmap2::Mmap) -> anybytes::view::View<Header> {
    Bytes::from(map).view().unwrap()
}
```

## Features

By default the crate enables the `mmap` and `zerocopy` features.
Other optional features provide additional integrations:

- `bytes` &ndash; support for the [`bytes`](https://crates.io/crates/bytes) crate so `bytes::Bytes` can act as a `ByteSource`.
- `ownedbytes` &ndash; adds compatibility with [`ownedbytes`](https://crates.io/crates/ownedbytes) and implements its `StableDeref` trait.
- `mmap` &ndash; enables memory-mapped file handling via the `memmap2` crate.
- `zerocopy` &ndash; exposes the [`view`](src/view.rs) module for typed zero-copy access and allows using `zerocopy` types as sources.
- `pyo3` &ndash; builds the [`pybytes`](src/pybytes.rs) module to provide Python bindings for `Bytes`.

Enabling the `pyo3` feature requires the Python development headers and libraries
(for example `libpython3.x`). Running `cargo test --all-features` therefore
needs these libraries installed; otherwise disable the feature during testing.

## Examples

- [`examples/quick_start.rs`](examples/quick_start.rs) ‚Äì the quick start shown above
- [`examples/pybytes.rs`](examples/pybytes.rs) ‚Äì demonstrates the `pyo3` feature using `PyBytes`
- [`examples/from_python.rs`](examples/from_python.rs) ‚Äì wrap a Python `bytes` object into `Bytes`

[^1]: Recently added a new "Owned Bytes" variant, which still has all the downsides of a V-Table.

## Development

Run `./scripts/preflight.sh` from the repository root before committing. The
script formats the code and executes all tests, automatically installing required
tools if needed.

Kani proofs are executed separately with `./scripts/verify.sh`, which should be
run on a dedicated system. The script will install the Kani verifier
automatically. Verification can take a long time and isn't needed for quick
development iterations.
