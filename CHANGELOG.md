- `winnow::view_elems` now returns a Parser closure for idiomatic usage
- replaced `ByteOwner::as_any` with trait upcasting to `Any`
- `Bytes::downcast_to_owner` and `View::downcast_to_owner` now return `Result`
  and return the original value on failure
  in a dedicated AGENTS section
- add tests for weak reference upgrade/downgrade and Kani proofs for view helpers
- add Kani proofs covering `Bytes::try_unwrap_owner` and `WeakBytes` upgrade semantics
- add examples for quick start and PyAnyBytes usage
- add example showing how to wrap Python `bytes` into `Bytes`
- summarize built-in `ByteSource`s and show how to extend them
- added tests verifying `WeakView` upgrade and drop semantics
- clarify library overview and development instructions in README

- expanded module introduction describing use cases
- update bytes, ownedbytes, memmap2, zerocopy and pyo3 dependencies
- documented rationale for separating `ByteSource` and `ByteOwner`
- verify `cargo fmt` availability and install `rustfmt` via rustup if missing

- added `Bytes::map_file_region` to map a specific region of a file
- reverted automatic installation of Python development packages in the
  preflight script; rely on the system `python3-dev` package

  upcasting for downcasting
- removed rope-like store integration and async wrappers from the inventory
- noted new suggestions in `INVENTORY.md` for future work

  owner and updated `INVENTORY.md` accordingly
- removed the `serde` support idea from the inventory
- removed the unsafe derive macro idea from the inventory
- removed the `Iterator` support idea from the inventory as `Bytes` already
  dereferences to `[u8]`
